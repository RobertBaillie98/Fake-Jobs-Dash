# Fake-Jobs-Dash

My first attempt at a Dash Interactive Dashboard, with my first machine learning project in Python!

To run the dashboard, download the kaggle dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction and place it in the dataset folder.
All you need to do next is run the index!
